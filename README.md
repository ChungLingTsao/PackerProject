# PackerProject
IT6039 Software Testing and Maintenance Project v1b

## Overview
The objective for this project was to demonstrate plan testing, design a suite of unit tests, debug and refactor an application.
The application is for a company that operates several depots that packs products into boxes and dispatches them to customers via trucks.

## Description
The application is written in Java and is documented with JavaDoc comments.
It should read incoming orders from text files, determine how the products are to be boxed and generates the labels for the boxes.
At the start of the project, there were logical and syntax errors that needed to be fixed until the application behaved as expected.
